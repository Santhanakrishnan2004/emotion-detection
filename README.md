Sure! Here's a sample **README.md** file for your Flask Hugging Face emotion analyzer app. It includes instructions on setting up a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and configuring your Hugging Face API token.

# Emotion Analyzer Flask App using Hugging Face API

This is a simple Flask web app that analyzes the emotion of input text using the Hugging Face Inference API with the `bhadresh-savani/distilbert-base-uncased-emotion` model.

## Features

- Submit text via a web form
- Get the top emotion predicted by the Hugging Face model
- Lightweight Flask backend with API integration

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A Hugging Face API token (create a free account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) and get your token from your profile settings)

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository (or copy your app files)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-analyzer.git
cd emotion-analyzer
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

---

### 3. Install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, create one with:

```
Flask
requests
python-dotenv
```

---

### 4. Add your Hugging Face API token

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

```
HF_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_token_here
```

Replace `your_huggingface_api_token_here` with your actual token.

---

### 5. Run the Flask app

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the app runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

---

### 6. Using the app

* Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
* Enter any text in the form and submit
* The app will display the top detected emotion from the Hugging Face model

---

## Troubleshooting

* If you get an authorization error, double-check your API token in `.env`
* Ensure your virtual environment is activated before running the app
* Make sure your internet connection is active (API calls need to reach Hugging Face)
